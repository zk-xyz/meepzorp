## 11. Knowledge Base and Orchestration Strategy

### 11.1 Knowledge Base Build
- Use Supabase with **pgvector** to store documents, chunks and embeddings.
- The Document Processor ingests PDFs and other formats, producing chunked text and vector embeddings.
- Entities and relationships are stored using a lightweight graph model. Neo4j or a similar graph store can be added later for complex querying.
- Provide REST endpoints for creating, querying, updating and deleting knowledge items.
- Combine vector search with graph relations (GraphRAG style) to enable semantic and relational reasoning.

### 11.2 Orchestration & Workflow
- The FastAPI orchestration service remains the central coordinator.
- Agents register their capabilities with the registry on startup.
- The router matches requested capabilities to registered agents and forwards requests with retries.
- The workflow engine executes multi-step workflows, mapping variables between steps and persisting results.
- Workflow definitions and execution state are stored in Supabase for auditing and re-use.

### 11.3 Multi-Agent Workflow Example
1. A document is uploaded through the Document Processor.
2. The Personal Knowledge Agent indexes the content and extracts entities.
3. The Task Agent composes a workflow referencing available capabilities.
4. Specialized agents execute workflow steps in sequence via the orchestration API.
5. Results are stored and can be queried or visualized in the management UI.
